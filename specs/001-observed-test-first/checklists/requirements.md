# Specification Quality Checklist: Observed test-first

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The product is a developer tool, so its users are project owners and the agent; Spec Kit,
  Claude Code, git and JUnit XML are named because they are the product's boundary (what it
  plugs into and the format it reads), not implementation choices. How records are stored, how
  replays are isolated and which language the scripts use are left to the plan.
- No clarification needed: the description fixed scope, verdicts and exclusions.
